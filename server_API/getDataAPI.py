# Python 3 server example
'''
Dynamic ports, also known as private or ephemeral ports, are 
temporary communication endpoints (ports) used by client 
applications to initiate network connections with servers, 
allocated by the operating system from a predefined range 
(49152 to 65535) and released after the connection is closed.
